## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup & Deployment

To use PokerPal, you need to connect it to your own Firebase project and deploy it. This setup ensures that your data is private and secure. The recommended way to deploy is with Vercel.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **"Add project"** and give it a name (e.g., "PokerPal Tracker").
3.  Follow the on-screen steps to create the project. Google Analytics is optional.

### 2. Create a Firestore Database

1.  In your new Firebase project, go to the **Build > Firestore Database** section.
2.  Click **"Create database"**.
3.  Start in **production mode**.
4.  Choose a location for your database (e.g., `us-central`).
5.  Click **"Enable"**.

### 3. Set Firestore Security Rules

For a small, trusted group of friends, you can use open rules that allow anyone authenticated with your project to read and write data.

1.  In the Firestore section, go to the **"Rules"** tab.
2.  Replace the existing rules with the following:
    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Allow read/write access to all documents
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if true;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  Click **"Publish"**.

### 4. Get Your Firebase App Credentials

1.  Go to **Project Settings** (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon next to "Project Overview").
2.  In the **"General"** tab, scroll down to **"Your apps"**.
3.  Click the **web icon (`</>`)** to create a new web app.
4.  Give it a nickname (e.g., "PokerPal Web") and click **"Register app"**.
5.  Firebase will show you your configuration credentials (an object with `apiKey`, `authDomain`, etc.). **Copy these values.** You will need them for the deployment step.

### 5. Deploy with Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel provides a seamless deployment experience for Next.js apps.

1.  **Fork this Repository**: Create a copy of this project on your own GitHub account.
2.  **Sign up on Vercel**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with your GitHub account.
3.  **Import Project**: From your Vercel dashboard, click **"Add New... > Project"**.
4.  **Select Repository**: Find and select the repository you forked.
5.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   Expand the **"Environment Variables"** section.
    *   Add the Firebase credentials you copied earlier. Each key-value pair from your Firebase config needs to be a separate environment variable. The names must be:
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
6.  **Deploy**: Click the **"Deploy"** button.
7.  **Done!**: Vercel will build and deploy your site, giving you a public URL (e.g., `https://poker-pal-xxx.vercel.app`).

## üöÄ Using the App

1.  Open your deployed site's URL.
2.  **Create a Home Game**: The first person to use the app will be prompted to create a new "Home Game". This involves:
    *   Choosing a `Home Game Code` (like a password for your group).
    *   Adding the names of the initial players.
3.  **Share with Friends**: Share the URL and the `Home Game Code` with your friends.
4.  **Join the Game**: Your friends will use the "Join Game" tab and enter the code to get access to the shared session data.

From now on, everyone in the group can add sessions and see the shared leaderboard!
