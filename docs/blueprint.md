## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#764BA2), embodying sophistication and playfulness. Chosen as a middle ground between the user's blue and purple preference, but without literally applying those requests.
- Background color: A light grey (#EAEAEA), offering a clean, neutral backdrop that emphasizes the purple accents and provides good readability.
- Accent color: A deep blue (#667EEA), providing a clear contrast to highlight key interactive elements like buttons and links.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a clean, modern, objective design.
- Minimalist icons to represent different functionalities (e.g., calendar for sessions, trophy for leaderboard).
- Responsive design with a tab-based navigation for main sections (Sessions, Leaderboard, Setup).
- Subtle hover effects and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance interactivity.
